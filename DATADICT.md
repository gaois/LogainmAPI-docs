# Logainm Application Programming Interface (Version 0.5): Data dictionary

**Note:** This documentation describes a **prerelease** version of the Logainm API. Features are being added on an ongoing basis. The documentation will be revised in advance of the v1.0 release.

This document describes the data structure of the results made available via the Logainm Application Programming Interface (API). Logainm is a comprehensive management system for data, archival records and placenames research conducted by the Government of Ireland. For general information regarding the API and for developer guidelines please consult the [developer documentation](https://github.com/gaois/LogainmAPI-docs/blob/master/README.md).

## `place`

The `place` object is at the core of the Logainm API: it represents a geographic location and includes associated toponymic, lexical, and other metadata. Queries to the API may return one or more `place` objects. The information below describes the properties of this object type.
