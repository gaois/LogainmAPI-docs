# Logainm Application Programming Interface (Version 0.5): Data dictionary

**Note:** This documentation describes a **prerelease** version of the Logainm API. Features are being added on an ongoing basis. The documentation will be revised in advance of the v1.0 release.

This document describes the data structure of the results made available via the Logainm Application Programming Interface (API). Logainm is a comprehensive management system for data, archival records and placenames research conducted by the Government of Ireland. For general information regarding the API and for developer guidelines please consult the [developer documentation](https://github.com/gaois/LogainmAPI-docs/blob/master/README.md).

## `placeList`

Most API queries will return a `placeList` object. This contains a list of one or places, if found, and additional metadata related to the query.

| Property name   | Type                | Cardinality         | Description               |
| :-------------- | :------------------ | :------------------ | :------------------------ |

| Places          | [`place`](#place)     | none or one or many | The retrieved place records. |
| SimilarNames    | string              | none or one or many | A set of names which have a similar spelling to the query text (if performing a textual search). For example, if searching for 'Ballybunion', 'Ballybunnion' will be suggested. |

## `place`

The `place` object is at the core of the Logainm API: it represents a geographic location and includes associated toponymic, lexical, and other metadata. Queries specifying a place identifer in the request path will retrieve a single `place` object (if one exists) while broader queries may return one or more `place` objects in the response body.
